# Raspberry-Pi-Robot-Car

This is my code used to control a small robot car using a Raspberry Pi.  Along with being able to control the car with the keyboard, the car can drive itself by tracing a black line along the floor using the camera.  Additionally, the car has an IMU attached to be able to observe the acceleration and rotation rate of the car.

Files I personally wrote include hw7frazier.c (main) and hw7frazier_camera.c (used to enable the camera and trace a black line)
